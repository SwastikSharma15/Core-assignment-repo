    Sidebar.jsx
    TopBar.jsx
    PeopleGrid.jsx
    EmployeeCard.jsx

## Assumptions

- Static data used for employee grid as no backend/API was provided.
- Icons exported directly from Figma and used as SVGs.
- Fonts approximated as per design where exact font files were unavailable.
- Interaction behavior implemented based on visual cues from design.

## Notes

The implementation prioritizes clean code structure, maintainability, and visual accuracy. Spacing, border radius, and layout proportions have been carefully matched to the Figma design.
